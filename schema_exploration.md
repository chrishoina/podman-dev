<!-- The most basic, but not a bad place to start for, ‘Hello World?’ We will have the sample schemas on FreeSQL hosted databases, so perhaps a prompt to explore the HR or SH schema, ask it to identify missing indexes (foreign keys?), to create locally in the users’s current schema, and suggest more verbose table/column comments or 23ai annotations?, generate a relational diagram?  -->

<!-- yes but sample schema better not have missing indexes and such or that has to be fixed. Also the sample schemas are centralized so they can not comment/alter/.. anything about them

we could have the llm re-create the sample schemas locally with the ‘enhanced’ comments or even annotations in 23ai
no comment non missing indexes, but yeah no need to point out our deficiencies -->
